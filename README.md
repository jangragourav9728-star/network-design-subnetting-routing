# Network Design using Subnetting and Routing

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a small enterprise network using subnetting and routing concepts.

##  Objectives
- Implement subnetting for efficient IP address usage
- Connect multiple networks using routing
- Understand real-world enterprise network design

##  Network Architecture
- 1 Router
- 3 Switches (IT, HR, Admin)
- Multiple PCs
- Cisco Packet Tracer used for simulation

##  IP Addressing Scheme
| Department | Network | Subnet Mask |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| IT | 192.168.1.0/26 | 255.255.255.192 |
| HR | 192.168.1.64/27 | 255.255.255.224 |
| Admin | 192.168.1.96/28 | 255.255.255.240 |

##  Routing
Routing is configured on the router using FastEthernet interfaces to allow communication between different subnets.

##  Testing
Connectivity between different subnets was verified using ping commands.

##  Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Networking fundamentals

##  Result
All devices successfully communicate across different subnets, proving correct implementation of subnetting and routing.

##  Learning Outcome
- Practical understanding of subnetting
- Routing between multiple networks
- Enterprise-level network design basics
